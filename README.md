# About Me

Yo, i'm MilesSam. I'm a visionary dedicated to transforming our understanding of the universe and creating a future where everyone's wellbeing is prioritized. My mission is to eliminate the coercive systems of governments and economic controls that force people into unwellness through arbitrary laws and value judgments tied to money.

I believe in developing advanced technologies like mind-reading sensors and compassionate AI, making them omnipresent and accessible to everyone. By integrating these technologies seamlessly into our lives, we can ensure that informed decisions are made without coercion, fostering a world of mutual respect and shared understanding.

I‚Äôm passionate about using sustainable materials like graphene, cobalt, gold, and diamonds to build hubs that symbolize unity and collaboration. These hubs will be spaces where poetry, science, and healing merge into a boundless form of expression, enhancing our collective wellbeing.

My approach involves creating a system where all information is omnipresent and integrated into each mind, eliminating misunderstandings and maximizing safety. It's about fostering an environment where true freedom, compassion, and universal peace are the norms.

Join me in this transformative journey as we push the boundaries of what's possible and work together to rescue the universe. üåç‚ú®
